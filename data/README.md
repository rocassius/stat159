## Data Files

This folder is designed to put all .csv files downloaded from OSF. However, due to the size
of these files, we are not going to include them on Github. Instead, the python scripts from
each assignments will download each of the following files when the first time they are used.

* stations_ca.csv - [https://osf.io/ev7y2/download](https://osf.io/ev7y2/download)

* weather_data_ca.csv - [https://osf.io/qvyw5/download](https://osf.io/qvyw5/download)

* ucr_offenses_known_monthly_1960_2016_dta.zip - [https://www.openicpsr.org/openicpsr/project/100707/version/V7/view](https://www.openicpsr.org/openicpsr/project/100707/version/V7/download/file?filePath=/openicpsr/100707/fcr:versions/V7/ucr_offenses_known_monthly_1960_2016_dta.zip)
