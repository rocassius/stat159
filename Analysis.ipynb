Then, we excluded the rest by computing the polygon boarder for Alameda County and checked whether a station was within the polygon or within 5 miles from it.

We connected these points into lines and checked if each station is either within the polygon or is within 5 miles from any of these border lines. The algorithm has the following two parts:\n",

    "* **Check if a point is within the polygon**: For any point within a polygon, if we draw a line toward arbitary direction, it should cut the border line an odd number of times.

The algorithm will first check if the two endpoints of the border line are within the circle by computing their distances; if not, the algorithm will try to find a perpendicular line from the given point to the border line and compute the distance to check if it is less than or equal to 5 miles.\n",

We did this by constructing 11 bins (representing the 11 different 10-degree temperature ranges) and having each bin contain the per-month count for the relevant year (01/1980 to 12/2009). For a given bin and year-month, there is a count for the number of days in the month that belong to that particular bin. The data is aggregated for temperature and precipitation by weighting the data for each relevant station of that particular bin and year-month combination by using each station's inverse distance weight and then taking the average of all of those weighted values. These averages are then put into their corresponding bins and represent the distribution of counts across bins by year-month. "

    "## Approach \n",
    "\n",
    "**$Null\\space Hypothesis$**: The temperatures in Oakland and Livermore are the same. That is, their maximum and minimum temperatures come from the same underlying distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to test this, we must perform the following tasks:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Get the data from the stations for the days on which both stations report\n",
    "2. Create 1000 permutations of these data and then for each permutation:\n",
    "    - separate the data by month\n",
    "    - for each month, bin the temperatures using the same bins as before  \n",
    "    - get a p-value for each month using a chi-square contingency table\n",
    "    - combine the p-values using the Fisher combining function to get the Fisher combination statistic\n",

    "\n",
    " - What did you stratify on? Why is that a good choice? \n",
    "     - We will stratify on month. This is a natural and sensible choice for stratification because Ranson binned and analyzed weather patterns according to month  \n",
    "     \n",
    " - Why stratify at all?\n",
    "      - In this context, stratification is a logical choice because we know that weather patterns change according to season. The weather is hotter in the Summer and colder in the Winter. Thus, pooling all temperature data together as if it were generated from a single distribution would be overlooking this general knowledge. \n",

The complication is that fitting two models will always fit somewhat better than a single model, because there are more parameters. Consider some combined measure of the fit of the two models to their corresponding data, e.g., RMS error. That's the test statistic. Now, randomly split the data into two pieces. For instance, take the two sets of monthly binned weather data and crime data, and toss a fair coin to decide whether East Alameda gets its original data, or the data from West Alameda (West gets whichever East didn't get. The randomization needs to keep the weather and crime for a given month together, so we allocate each entire month of weather and crime data to one location or to the other.) Fit two models to these randomized data, and calculate the RMS error. Repeat many times. If the RMS error of the two models to the randomly assigned data is typically much larger than it is for the original data, that's evidence that the relationship between weather and crime is truly different in the two parts of the county."

    " - Explain the particular randomization you are using, its assumptions, and your justification for using it as the null hypothesis.\n",
    "     - Because Ranson modeled crime and weather as being related by month, we will be using a by-month randomization method. Since we are assuming with our null hypothesis that the crime and weather data from East and West Alameda are consistent with a single model, if we randomly swap their data by month, there should not be a significant impact on the test statistic RMS. This particular monthly randomization and the subsequent RMS calculations allow us to determine whether or not there is evidence that the relationship between crime and weather is truly different for East Alameda and West Alameda."

    "In this project, we aggregated crime and weather data from Alameda County in the fashion described by Professor Matthew Ranson in his paper \"Crime, Weather & Climate Change.\" We also attempted to reproduce some of his analyses and validate some of his critical assumptions. Ranson performs his analyses and develops a predictive model by county and month. To do so, he makes various assumptions that he fails to verify. Namely, he assumes that weather is effectively the same across all counties, and he assumes that a single Poisson Regression model can adequately describe the relationship between crime and weather throughout a single state. \n",
    "\n",
    "The first half over our project was devoted to gathering and assembling crime and weather data for Alameda County in a transparent and reproducible fashion. Throughout this process, we discovered that we still had to make choices of our own during the data preparation process. For example, we chose to filter some of the GHCN-Daily weather data that had allegedly already been cleansed because some of the reported maximum temperatures were less than reported minimum temperatures on certain days. Thus, a significant takeaway that we had from this assignment and our consequent analyses is that in order to make work reproducible, it is critically important to carefully document the data engineering choices you make and any underlying assumptions. We also questioned a number of Ranson’s choices, including the choice to aggregate weather by month, instead of, for example, by week. \n",
    "\n",
    "The final half of our project is devoted to testing the validity of Ranson’s aforementioned assumptions. Our first permutation test concluded that Oakland and Livermore, despite both being cities in Alameda County, have experienced different temperatures, meaning that their temperatures are inherently different. Thus, the test proved that Ranson’s assumption that weather behavior is the same countywide is invalid. Lastly, using another permutation test we showed that it is unreasonable to believe that a Poisson single model can adequately describe the relationship between weather and crime in a single county, let alone a single state. Therefore, because we have proven a few of Ranson’s assumptions invalid, this leads us to view his further conclusions with skepticism. \n"
